# content/articles/ — article source

One `.mdx` file per article; the filename (minus `.mdx`) is the slug.

**Frontmatter** is validated by a Zod schema in `@/lib/articles`:
- required: `title`, `description`, `date`
- optional: `updated`, `tags` (string[]), `draft` (boolean)

**Drafts** (`draft: true`) render only when `NODE_ENV !== "production"` — hidden in the production build.

**TOC** is derived from `##`/`###` headings via regex, so heading text drives the anchor slug. Reading time is computed automatically.

Custom MDX components (`<Define>`, `<CodeBlock>`, `<FrameworkBadge>`, etc.) are registered in `components/mdx/mdx-content.tsx`. For voice and authoring workflow, use the `article-writing` skill.
